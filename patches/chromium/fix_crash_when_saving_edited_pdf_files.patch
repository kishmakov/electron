Subject: fix: crash when saving edited PDF files

Originally, this patch contained a code change. Since then, the code has
been upstreamed[1] but placed behind a flag. This patch now enables the
flag by default, therefore using the code fix from the original patch.

This flag will eventually be removed and the original code fix will be
all that is left behind. When that happens, this patch will be safe to
remove.

Original patch description:

> This commit fixes a crash that persists any time a user attempts to
> download an edited PDF. This was happening because the logic flow for
> downloading of any edited PDF triggers a call to
> chrome.fileSystem.chooseEntry, which we do not support and which
> therefore causes unmapped page access crashes.
>
> This patch can be removed should we choose to support chrome.fileSystem
> or support it enough to fix the crash.
